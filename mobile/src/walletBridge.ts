/**
 * Mobile Wallet Adapter, reachable from inside the WebView.
 *
 * # Why this exists
 *
 * The game runs in a WebView, and its wallet layer is `@solana/wallet-adapter`
 * — which looks for a browser extension. On Android there is no extension:
 * Phantom and Solflare are apps, and the way to reach them is Mobile Wallet
 * Adapter, which speaks over an Android intent and cannot be called from
 * JavaScript in a web page.
 *
 * So the native side owns MWA and hands the WebView a provider shaped exactly
 * like the one an extension injects. The game connects, signs and sends without
 * knowing it is on a phone, and nothing in the web app had to change.
 *
 * # The contract
 *
 * The page calls `window.phantom.solana.*`. Each call posts a message here,
 * this module runs the real MWA session, and the answer is delivered back by
 * evaluating `window.__mempireResolve(id, ...)` in the page. Requests carry an
 * id because a signature request and a connect can be in flight together.
 *
 * # What is deliberately not cached
 *
 * MWA hands out an `auth_token` that lets a later session reconnect without a
 * second approval. It is held in memory only. Persisting it would mean a
 * process that can sign for the wallet surviving in storage, and the thing this
 * app guards is a wallet — a re-approval per launch is the correct trade.
 */

/**
 * MWA is an Android intent protocol and its native module only exists there. A
